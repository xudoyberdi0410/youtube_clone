# Sample Video Files

To test the video player, add video files to this public folder:

- `sample-video.mp4` - Main demo video
- `sample-video-2.mp4` - Additional demo video

You can use any MP4 video files for testing. Some free sample videos can be downloaded from:
- https://sample-videos.com/
- https://file-examples.com/
- https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/

Place your video files directly in the `/public` folder to use them with the video player.
